### Step 2: Create Environment File

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholders:
   ```bash
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret_here
   SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
   ```
